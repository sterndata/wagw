10 – 20 seconds. That’s your window of engagement when someone visits your website. So it’s critical that the visual is enticing and the message is compelling.

What A Great Website! builds marketing-driven, custom websites that engage visitors — so you can tell them your story.

This is the theme for https://whatagreatwebsite.net.

It is built on a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. `_s` comes from Automattic and is the base for the themes they develop.  

Your business is unique. Your needs are as well. So it stands to reason that your website shouldn’t be like anyone else’s.

At What A Great Website, we approach web development on a case-by-case basis. Since your business is unique, we think your website should be, too.

Your site should have a special look and feel that reflects who you are and what you do — not look like one of your competitors. That special look and feel is what we build into your site.

That's wny we build our own, just for you, but build on a solid foundation from the experts at Automattic.
